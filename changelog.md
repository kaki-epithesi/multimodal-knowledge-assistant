# Changelog

## v0.3 â€“ Basic Q&A (BM25/TF-IDF Retrieval)
**Release Date:** 01-09-2025  

### âœ¨ Features
- Added **Q&A retrieval pipeline** using BM25/TF-IDF:
  - Implemented `Indexer` service to build and persist retrieval index (`data/index.pkl`).
  - Implemented `Retriever` service to load index and fetch top-k ranked snippets.
  - Added `POST /query` endpoint to retrieve relevant text snippets from ingested documents.
- Updated ingestion flow:
  - After file upload and chunking, all chunks in SQLite are used to rebuild the BM25 index.
  - Ensures queries are available immediately after document ingestion.
- Supports multiple document ingestion (all chunks across files are included in index).

### ðŸ§ª Testing
- Added `tests/test_qa.py` for query endpoint:
  - Returns 404 if index not built.
  - Returns ranked snippets when index exists.
- Ingestion tests still valid and extended to check indexing flow.

### ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
- Added `rank-bm25` and `scikit-learn` for BM25 and TF-IDF retrieval.
- Reused existing dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pymupdf`, `pytest`, `httpx`, `python-multipart`).

  - TXT file upload and chunk storage.  
  - PDF file upload and text extraction.  
  - File listing.  
  - File download by ID.  
- DB reset before each test to ensure isolation.
